<h3>AI-based assistant for Minecraft</h3>

<h4>There are 4 steps to build</h4>
<h4>1-I'm using collecting_data.png as a structure to take shots with collect.py and save those imgs in a img_datas folder</h4>
<h4>2-With img datas, I can start now my training process (train.py)</h4>
<h4>3-Now I'm creating a file(data_classes.py) full of the classes of my images</h4>
<h4>4-The last step is using detect.py and play!</h4>
<h5> don't forget to press 1 to predict,but you can easily change the predictive button </h5>
