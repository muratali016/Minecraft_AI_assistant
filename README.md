# Minecraft_AI_assistant
AI-based assistant for Minecraft

There are 4 steps to build
1-I'm using collecting_data.png as a structure to take shots with collect.py and save those imgs in a img_datas folder
2-With img datas, I can start now my training process (train.py)
3-Now I'm creating a folder full of the classes of my images
4-The last step is using detect.py and play!
